# Shindy’s Notes:

Outcomes for the course

## **CENTER DATA AROUND PEOPLE**

We currently have data that reflects pandemic impact by country, county and, in the case of NYC, zip code. We want to expand the project in the following ways:

1. **Center the data around people/demographics**
   1. Collect and present race and ethnicity data in the USA
   2. Collect and display data on essential/frontline workers especially those that are especially vulnerable to the ravages of the pandemic because of
      1. Occupations (high contact/travel/inability to distance or isolate/poor or no health benefits including sick leave)
      2. Risk of spreading in their families/communities (housing density)
      3. Underlying conditions
      4. Racism in healthcare
2. **Center the data in stories** 3. Use data visualization/data storytelling (discuss why this is useful and what to consider when creating compelling narratives through data) 4. Collect and present stories as audio files (story corps); journalistic articles (newspaper stories, articles etc); video vignettes; slideshows; other multimedia

## **ART AND MEMORIALS:**

1. Explore the role of various art forms in creating compelling digital memorials or community based memorial experiences (students can write up a concept/treatment centering memorialization in their performing/visual art experience)

   <td>PUBLISHED APRIL 2020
<p>
Racial disparities are apparent in the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in the United States, yet the factors contributing to racial inequities in COVID‐19 mortality remain controversial. To better understand these factors, we investigated racial disparities in COVID‐19 mortality among America's essential workers. Data from the American Community Survey and Current Population Survey was used to examine the correlation between the prevalence of COVID‐19 deaths and occupational differences across racial/ethnic groups and states. COVID‐19 mortality was higher among non‐Hispanic (NH) Blacks compared with NH Whites, due to more NH Blacks holding essential‐worker positions. Vulnerability to coronavirus exposure was increased among NH Blacks, who disproportionately occupied the top nine essential occupations. As COVID‐19 death rates continue to rise, existing structural inequalities continue to shape racial disparities in this pandemic. Policies mandating the disaggregation of state‐level data by race/ethnicity are vital to ensure equitable and evidence‐based response and recovery efforts.

This course will use the open source [COVID-19 Impact Dashboard](https://epvisual.com/COVID-19-Impact/Dashboard) as a base to explore ways to humanize the unfolding data on the pandemic. We will learn how data flows from public github repositories and what tools are needed to visualize the data. We will review other COVID-19 dashboards to analyze what questions they are trying to answer. Beyond presentation we will ask what stories we want to tell to aid in memorializing and grieving those who we have lost to the pandemic. Students can choose to participate as javascript coders, p5js explorers, UI/UX designers, citizen journalists, data science explorers, or social justice warriors. We will meet three consecutive Fridays for 3 hours per day, February 12, 19, and 26. [https://epvisual.com/COVID-19-Impact/Project/](https://epvisual.com/COVID-19-Impact/Project/)

### **COVID-19: Digital Storytelling, Memorializing, Processing Grief**

The course will explore development of compelling digital memorials that will give face and voice to those lost to COVID-19 and provide a place for their loved ones to memorialize and grieve them. Using the open source [COVID-19 Impact Project](https://epvisual.com/COVID-19-Impact/Project/) as a base we will explore how to support community-driven mourning and memorialization through creative crowdsourced digital (visual-graphic) storytelling.

Students can choose to participate as javascript coders, p5js explorers, UI designers, citizen journalists, data science explorers, or social justice warriors. We will meet 3 days, 3 hours per day over 2-3 weeks[1]. We will review the current state of the project, brainstorm, propose contributions, and present contributions for feedback. Students will present at least one iteration of their contribution at the final meeting.

Course co-taught by John Henry Thompson and Shindy Johnson.

3 consecutive fridays Feb 5, 12, 19, 26

Data with context - comparing on the right scale

Ref: misuse of data blog, florida data science fired and home invaded

Data & Time: Looking at data over time - what stories/trends emerge that are not

apparent from other dashboards. How can we use visual

- Eg. pandemic more dispersed now vs. 6 months ago

Find COVID-related data sources on essential workers and race

Propose/mockup UI improvements to encourage sustained and repeat engagement with the app

I think you should contact this guy from your NYU address and see if he has thoughts on COVID Data and Story telling that he can share in the course/collaborate on. He specializes in company valuations but I think he has the kind of mind and depth of research that could be useful. Ask Dan's help in reaching him if needed

jht: This is good outline for first meeting

**Roadmap**

**The COVID-19 Impact Project** is a “living” website reliant on collaboration and contribution from many sources and is therefore a continuous work-in-progress.

The COVID-19 Impact Project has an open source github repository at

[https://github.com/EP-Visual-Design/COVID-19-Impact-Project.git](https://github.com/EP-Visual-Design/COVID-19-Impact-Project.git) which invites developers to enhance the source code and help fulfil the technical vision for the project.

### **Technical Vision: Data, UI**

The [COVID-19 Impact Dashboard](https://epvisual.com/COVID-19-Impact/Dashboard/) currently displays global statistics on cases and deaths from the country-level and drilling down to the state and county levels. The first step in assessing the impact of this pandemic is to break down the huge numbers we see internationally to local-level statistics.

This course seeks to get under the hood of COVID-19 Dashboards to source, audit and convert data to human readable formats. In addition, in this course we will discuss and apply methods for:

- Enhancing the public repo to drill down to community-level statistics
- Connecting to statistics on essential workers and disproportionately affected communities, particularly communities of color.
- Upgrading the UI to encourage sustained and repeat engagement with the app.
- Converting raw data into visually compelling infographics

### **Humanistic Vision: Digital Storytelling, Memorializing, Processing Grief**

The course will explore development of compelling digital memorials that will give face and voice to those lost to COVID-19 and provide a place for their loved ones to memorialize and grieve them. One goal of the project is to support community-driven mourning and memorialization through creative crowdsourced digital storytelling.

### **Social and Economic Justice Vision: **

The course will explore digital storytelling as a platform to move people from a data stupor to engagement and action on the many injustices exposed by the pandemic. The Project will drive political action to remedy systemic inequalities laid bare by the pandemic from the local to the national levels.

   <td>PUBLISHED APRIL 2020
<p>
Racial disparities are apparent in the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in the United States, yet the factors contributing to racial inequities in COVID‐19 mortality remain controversial. To better understand these factors, we investigated racial disparities in COVID‐19 mortality among America's essential workers. Data from the American Community Survey and Current Population Survey was used to examine the correlation between the prevalence of COVID‐19 deaths and occupational differences across racial/ethnic groups and states. COVID‐19 mortality was higher among non‐Hispanic (NH) Blacks compared with NH Whites, due to more NH Blacks holding essential‐worker positions. Vulnerability to coronavirus exposure was increased among NH Blacks, who disproportionately occupied the top nine essential occupations. As COVID‐19 death rates continue to rise, existing structural inequalities continue to shape racial disparities in this pandemic. Policies mandating the disaggregation of state‐level data by race/ethnicity are vital to ensure equitable and evidence‐based response and recovery efforts.
